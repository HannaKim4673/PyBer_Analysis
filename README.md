# PyBer Ride-sharing Data Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose
The main purpose of analyzing the ride-sharing data for the PyBer app was to find relationships between city types, number of drivers and riders, and the percentage of total drivers, riders, and ride fares by city type and create various graphs and figures to relay information on these relationships to PyBer company workers and stakeholders, so that the app could be improved and made more affordable. In the case of the challenge, the new goal was to create a new DataFrame containing ride-sharing data separated by city type, use that DataFrame to create a multiple-line graph that displays each city's weekly fares, and use that multiple-line graph to see if there are any notable differences in weekly ride fares amongst the three different city types.

## Results

### Differences in Total Rides Amount for Each City Type
As visible in the highlighted portion of the table below, rural cities had the least number of total rides, urban cities had the highest total rides amount, and suburban cities had much less total rides than urban cities but more total rides than rural cities.

### Differences in Total Drivers Amount for Each City Type
As visible in the green highlighted portion of the table below, rural cities had the least number of drivers, urban cities had the highest amount of drivers, and suburban cities had much less drivers than urban cities but more drivers than rural cities.

### Differences in Total Fares Amount for Each City Type
As visible in the red highlighted portion of the table below, rural cities had the lowest total fare, urban cities had the highest total fare, and suburban cities had a much lower total fare than urban cities but a higher fare than rural cities.

### Differences in Average Fare per Ride Amount for Each City Type
Interestingly, as visible in the blue highlighted portion of the table below, urban cities had the lowest average fare per ride amount, rural cities had the highest average fare per ride amount, and suburban cities had a much higher average fare per ride amount than urban cities but slightly lower amount than rural cities.

### Differences in Average Fare per Driver Amount for Each City Type
Much like the results in the previous section, as seen in the purple highlighted portion of the table below, urban cities had the lowest average fare per driver amount, rural cities had the highest average fare per driver amount, and suburban cities had a much higher average fare per driver amount than urban cities but a higher amount than rural cities.

### Differences in Total Fares for Each City Type
As seen in the multiple-line graph below, over a span of 4 months, rural cities consistently had the lowest total fare, urban cities consistently had the highest total fare, and suburban cities consistently had a total fare amount that was less than that of urban cities and more than the total fare of rural cities.

## Summary

### Suggestion 1
It may be best to lower the fare for rides in rural cities. This way, not only will the average fare per ride in rural cities become closer to that of suburban and urban cities, but people may be more inclined to call for rides in rural cities, which will increase the number of total rides in rural cities and bring that amount closer to the number of total rides in suburban and urban cities.

### Suggestion 2
In line with the first suggestion, it may also be a good idea to make more drivers available in rural cities. This way, even if the fare for rides in rural areas is decreased to make rides more appealing and accessible, rural cities will be able to make enough money on ride fares to catch up with the total fare amount of suburban and maybe even urban cities in a given month.

### Suggestion 3
In the case of suburban cities, it may be best to add a few more drivers and lower the fare for rides a little, but not as much as the changes I suggested for the rural cities. After all, while suburban cities do make less money on ride fares than urban cities, just like rural cities, the total fare amount made by suburban cities in a given month is not too far away from the total fare amount made by urban cities, at least compared to the total fare amount made by rural cities. As a result, the number of drivers and the ride fare in suburban cities do not need to be adjusted as much as the number of drivers and the ride fare in rural cities.
